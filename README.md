# SQL Stored Procedures and Transactions

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Credit to IBM and the Coursera platform for providing the course materials and guidance.

## Objective

My objective for this practical assignment is to work with various real-world datasets sourced from the Chicago Data Portal. I will demonstrate my understanding of the data by answering questions similar to those tackled by a data engineer. The assessment will focus on the accuracy of my SQL queries and the outcomes they produce.

In particular, I will be responsible for crafting SQL code to establish a view that restricts data access for users. Additionally, I will create a stored procedure enabling users to update Leader Icons in the table. To ensure data integrity, I will enclose this update code within a transaction, safeguarding the consistency of the data in case of errors.
